Data Science Beginner Projects
Follow the tutorial so that you can start with Python machine learning just like I did: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
This tutorial is not a prediction model as such but a small attempt to explain the syntaxes and basic steps that everyone neds to follow to make any kind of Data Science project. For a beginner like me, this dataset worked like a charm as it has no missing values and just a hands on of the different prediction algorithms that have been used. Comparision of each of those is also done based on different parameters. 
Feel free to try the code.
I have used Jupyter notebook. You can use any other IDE for that matter. The main reason is that we need not install the dependencies one by one and you get all the libraries and packages preinstalled with jupyter notebooks.
